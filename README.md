# Lipid_Models

This repository contains a script to compare lipid data and related proteins for different model species. 

We selected three databases (Gene Ontology, Reactome, WikiPathways) and the genes within related to "lipid metabolism".
Comparing these three database, we see the following overlap:

We then cluster these genes based on the type of reaction they catalyze, based on the Enzyme Nomenclature:

The genes that overlap between two or more databases, are then compared to other species for homologs.
